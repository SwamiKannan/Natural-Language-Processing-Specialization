# [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
## Programming Assignments
<b><i>Disclaimer</b></i><br>
<i>You should only use the programming assignments placed in this repository as a resource and to get you out of a jam. Do not simply copy and paste the code if you are a participant in this course; doing so will not help you. Please watch every lecture video, finish the quizzes and code assignments yourself as it is comparatively simple to understand.</i><br><br>

## About the Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.
This Specialization will equip you with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems. By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots.

This Specialization is for students of machine learning or artificial intelligence as well as software engineers looking for a deeper understanding of how NLP models work and how to apply them. Learners should have a working knowledge of machine learning, intermediate Python including experience with a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras), as well as proficiency in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. If you would like to brush up on these skills, we recommend the Deep Learning Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai and taught by Andrew Ng.

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.

## Applied Learning Project
This Specialization will equip you with machine learning basics and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:<br>
‚Ä¢ Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.<br>
‚Ä¢ Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.<br>
‚Ä¢ Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. <br>
‚Ä¢ Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and to build chatbots. Learn T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more with ü§ó  Transformers!

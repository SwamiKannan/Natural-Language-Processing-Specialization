# Course 3: Sequence Models in NLP

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:<br>

a) Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,<br>
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,<br>
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and <br>
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.


**Week 1: Sentiment with Neural Nets**

- Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets

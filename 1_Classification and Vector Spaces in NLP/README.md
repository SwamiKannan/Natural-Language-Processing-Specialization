# Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP
In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:   <br>

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes, <br>
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and <br>
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.  <br>


**Week 1: Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Use a simple method to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets

**Week 2: Naïve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis

**Week 3: Vector Space Models**

- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

**Week 4: Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation**

- Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
